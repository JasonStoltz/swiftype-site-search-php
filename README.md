## Getting started üê£

You can install the client in your project by using composer:

```bash
composer require swiftype/swiftype-site-search-php
```

## Usage

### Clients methods

Method name |Parameters| Description
------------|----------|------------
`createEngine` | - `$engineName` (required) <br /> - `$engineLanguage` | Create a new API based engine.<br />[Endpoint Documentation](https://swiftype.com/documentation/site-search/engines#create)
`deleteEngine` | - `$engineName` (required)  | Delete an engine by name.<br />[Endpoint Documentation](https://swiftype.com/documentation/app-search/api/engines#delete)
`getEngine` | - `$engineName` (required)  | Retrieves an engine by name.<br />[Endpoint Documentation](https://swiftype.com/documentation/site-search/engines#one-engine)
`listEngines` | - `$page`<br /> - `$perPage` | Retrieves all engines with optional pagination support.<br />[Endpoint Documentation](https://swiftype.com/documentation/site-search/engines#list)

## Development

Code for the endpoints are generated automatically using a custom version of [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator).

The easier way to regenerate endpoints is to use the docker laucher packaged in `vendor/bin`:

```bash
./vendor/bin/swiftype-codegen.sh
```

The custom generator will be build and launched using the following Open API spec file : `resources/api/api-spec.yml`.

You can then commit and PR your endpoint code and modified api-spec files.

The client class may be changed in some case. Do not forget to include it in your commit.
